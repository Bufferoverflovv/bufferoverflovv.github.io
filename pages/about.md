# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I'm a Cyber Security Engineer but in most of my spare time I like to make things in Unity. I've been using Unity for 6 years now and love to create and play video games. I'm also really interested in AI, Automation and SecDevOps. When I'm not on the computer you can usually find me at the bouldering gym or having a coffee.
