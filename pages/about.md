# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I'm a Cyber Security Engineer but in most of my spare time I like to make things in Unity. I've been using Unity for 6 years now and love to create and play video games. I'm also interested in other things such as AI, Automation, DevOps & FOSS. When I'm not working or at my computer you can usually find me bouldering or out having a coffee. Feel free to reach out or follow me on my socials @Bufferoverflovv or email me at jwdaniel94+portfolio@gmail.com
