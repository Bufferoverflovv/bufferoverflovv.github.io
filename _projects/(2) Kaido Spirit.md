# Kaido Spirit

Kaido Spirit was my next big solo project where I took lots of inspiration from popular anime series such as Initial D and Wangan midnight (Plus I was obssessed with Euro Beats lol). Some of the main inspirations for this game were also from the japanese arcade games as well. I had a lot of fun developing this but was also unfortunately a bit ambitious and I started to run into issues with creation of race tracks and real life locations. I think that if I had a few other people helping me on this project it might have even had a steam release! 

#Some additional videos and clips

## Express Way with AI 
This was a test with an express way track and an AI racer (The AI still needed a lot of work...)
