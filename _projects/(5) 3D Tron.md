description: A simple prototype that would take TRON or Snake from a 2D grid to a 3D world. The idea was to make this a mobile game.

# 3D Tron

3D Tron was a fairly basic idea I had when I burnt myself out from working on too many serious projects and prototypes. The premise was simple in that you could travel anywhere along the 3D object. Although I didn't get very far along with the prototype at the time when I made this I was finishing up at University and was taking exams I still think this would be a really cool party game or mobile game. This could be a fun project to come back to one day.

## The vertical slice
The first idea for the project. A 3D world made with probuilder and a cube with a trail.

## The first pass on AI
A trail made from a simple mesh was created behind the player and AI. The player or AI could get close to a wall to get an increase in speed. Hitting a wall meant death just like in TRON or Snake.
