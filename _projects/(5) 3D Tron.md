# 3D Tron

3D Tron was a fairly basic idea I had when I burnt myself out from working on too many serious projects and prototypes. The premise was simple in that you could travel anywhere along the 3D object. Although I didn't get very far along with the prototype at the time when I made this I was finishing up at University and was taking exams I still think this would be a really cool party game or mobile game.
