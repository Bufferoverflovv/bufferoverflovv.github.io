# WipEout Clone

This was a passion project of mine to try and replicate the feel, weight and physics of Wipeout one of my all time favourite arcade racing games. I developed this back in 2016 and did all of the development myself from the hover physics, controls, menus, AI. I wanted to release this as a commercial game but the game was far too ambitious and difficult for one person to develop. I think in the future I'd love to come back to this project, I have learned so much since 2016 that I could apply to this project.

## AI Flight Test 
The third iteration, AI was still a bit janky when following the racing line and vehicle physics were still being tweaked.
