# Procedural Solar System Generator

A friend of mine asked me to give him some help on his space roguelike and I created a procedural solar system generator. I'm actually quite proud of this and it was fun to make. A system generates its own number of planets including moons and jovials. The distance from the star meant that planets closer would be volcanic and planets further away would be ice worlds. Planets could have their own moon orbits and sattelites. Each celestial body also had its own orbit and rate of spin. There was also a randomized asteroid field just outside of the star.
